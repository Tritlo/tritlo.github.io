Hey there! I want to get into writing longer posts with less pressure than a published article.
I had a sort of [blog](http://blog.mpg.is/) earlier with some posts and another over at [medium](https://medium.com/@tritlo)
with some tutorials, butthose are very outdated at this point. I considered setting up a [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
site, but it's just easier to be able to configure it all right from GitHub.

I've been very active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tritlo) in the last few years, but the 280 characters limits you to
what is essentially aphorisms and no real detail. For sure one type of writing, but I want to be able to go into more detail
while not polluting others timelines with too much stuff. I've also created a lot of content over at [twitch](twitch.tv/tritlo)
and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUwAawsipFEocDM-1kdix6Q), and I'm especially proud of my various [talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1Cj70VxcjGUtCV3_kbOjzge_Vmq_6ak)
(I put a lot of effort into making them engaging) and I've had good times doing advent of code live on Twitch
(and the [recordings on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gloVx4kkEXQ&list=PLI1Cj70VxcjGMWMCN56b2tAMefARS4fyM).

During the pandemic I also got into video in general, and created a tutorial on how to look better online using [good lighting](https://youtu.be/phvwkwPxtQY),
and I got heavily involved in photography (which I mostly share on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tritlo/)).
Anyway, I hope this page here can be yet another creative outlet for me for more text heavy stuff. Hope you enjoy!
